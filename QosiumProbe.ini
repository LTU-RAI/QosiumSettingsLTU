% Made by: Kaitotek Oy
% Updated: 22.08.2024
% Purpose: Qosium Probe's parameters are controlled via this file. 
% NOTE: The parameters are read when starting up Qosium Probe. Thus, if you change parameters here, 
%       a restart of the Probe is required in order to activate the effects of the changes.  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% All the parameters are in the form:
% <parameter_name> <parameter_value>



% --- Server connectivity parameters ------------------------------

% Server IP address
%    There are some special values also: 
%    0 = common (all) address (0.0.0.0)
%    1 = loop-back address (127.0.0.1)
server_address 0

% Server port (0 = use default (8177))
server_port 8177

% Service ID
% This is one part of the Qosium's measurement identification. Specify here any number between 
% 0 and 4294967294 for your own measurement purposes. The set value will appear in the results. 
service_id 10


% --- Security parameters -----------------------------------------

% The mode of the allowed controlling entity addressess
%    0 = Function is off, i.e., control is not limited
%    1 = Manual mode, where each controlling entity address is manually set
%    2 = Masking mode, i.e., mask will be used instead of addresses
secu_ctrl_addr_mode 0

% This parameter sets the addresses who are allowed to control this Probe. 
% (separated by ";" NOTICE: no spaces!)
% When secu_ctrl_addr_mode = 2, define two addressess only: "the network address";"the bit mask"
secu_ctrl_addresses 0


% --- Positioning parameters --------------------------------------

% Location information, i.e., is location tracking used or not
% The allowed values are:
% 0 = positioning off
% 1 = GNSS with TSIP messages are used (Windows)
% 2 = GNSS with NMEA messages are used (Windows)
% 3 = GPSD API is used (Linux) 
% 4 = NMEA data from UDP messages
location_mode 0

% UDP NMEA message port
% If location_mode 4 is used, this parameter tells the UDP port to read. 
location_nmea_udp_port 7777


% --- Physical layer information collection parameters ------------

% The mode of the physical layer information collection: 
%   0 = Off
%   1 = AT commands
%   2 = External source (UDP)
%   3 = SNMP fetching
phy_collection_mode 1

% External source parameters:
phy_ext_udp_reception_port 8181

% General parameter for AT and SNMP: Polling interval for the results [ms]
% Range: 200 ms - 86400000 ms (1 day)
phy_info_polling_intrvl_ms 250

% -- AT command parameters:
% The following parameters determine how AT commands are used to fetch  the physical layer information.

% Device address
% This defines where the device can be found (e.g., a cellular modem). For example
% in Linux, this could be "/dev/ttyUSB1". 
phy_at_dev_address /dev/ttyUSB3

% Signal information collection command
% This defines the AT command to get signal information without the "AT+" part. 
% The supported commands are: 
%   CSQ		(AT+CSQ) is a general command for getting basic signal strength (RSSI)
%   QCSQ	(AT+QCSQ) is supported at least by some by Quectel modules to fetch 
%		extended signal information (RSSI, RSRP, RSRQ, SINR).
%   QENG	(AT+QENG="servingcell") is supported at least by RG50xQ&RM5xxQ Series Quectel modules 
%		to fetch extended signal information like previous. This returns also network information.
phy_at_signal_cmd QENG

% Network information collection command
% This defines the AT command to get network information without the "AT+" part. The network information
% collected includes the network type and the Cell ID. The only supported command is:
%   CREG	(AT+CREG) is a general command for getting network registration information
phy_at_netinfo_cmd CREG


% -- SNMP fetching parameters:
% The following parameters determine how SNMP is used to fetch the physical layer information. 

% Device IPv4 address
phy_snmp_dev_ipv4_addr 192.168.0.1

% The community string (often: "public")
phy_snmp_community_str public

% The object identifiers (OIDs) are set next. Check your device manual for the exact OIDs.
% Set NA if the particular statistic is not to be collected
% OID for fetching the Cell ID
phy_snmp_oid_cell_id 1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.2.11.192.168.1.175

% OID for fetching RSSI
phy_snmp_oid_rssi 1.3.6.1.4.1.48690.2.2.1.12.1

% OID for fetching SNR/SINR
phy_snmp_oid_snr 1.3.6.1.4.1.48690.2.2.1.19.1

% OID for fetching RSRP
phy_snmp_oid_rsrp 1.3.6.1.4.1.48690.2.2.1.20.1

% OID for fetching RSRQ
phy_snmp_oid_rsrq 1.3.6.1.4.1.48690.2.2.1.21.1

% OID for fetching the network type
phy_snmp_oid_net_type 1.3.6.1.4.1.48690.2.2.1.16.1



% --- Central server registration ---------------------------------

% Probe Registration: central Qosium Probe Server IP address 
central_server_address 127.0.0.1

% Probe Registration: central Qosium Probe Server port (0 = use default (8177))
central_server_port 0

% Registration lifetime, affecting also how often re-registration is carried out. 
% Unit: seconds
%   0 = registration is disabled
reg_lifetime 0


% --- Packet capturing ----------------------------------------------

% This defines the capture buffer size at Pcap. The parameter works in Windows and most of the Linux based systems. 
% If this parameter has too low value compared to the measured packet rate, there is a danger that Pcap will start 
% dropping packets. For heavy-duty measurements, 200 MB is the recommended value. You can scale it down or up 
* based on the need.
% NOTE: The amount of memory set here will be reserved for all simultaneous measurements using the Probe! Thus, 
%       if, e.g., one has 200 MB set here, 10 simultaneous measurements in this Probe will then reserve already 
%       about 2 GB of memory at the kernel level by Pcap.
% Unit: MB
pcap_cap_buff_size 200

% This parameter sets the maximum amount of memory that is allowed to be reserved by Pcap when using Qosium Probe. 
% Set this parameter according to the free RAM available (e.g., to 50 % of that) in the platform where Probe is running. 
% NOTE: The value set here together with the parameter pcap_cap_buff_size will limit the maximum number of 
%       simultaneous measurements that can be carried out using this Qosium Probe. The maximum is directly 
%       max_pcap_mem_reservation / pcap_cap_buff_size. 
% Unit: MB
max_pcap_mem_reservation 2000

% The snap length of the capture process. Use large enough value to capture the required portion of the packet. 
% Default and recommended value = 0, meaning an unlimited capture length. 
% Unit: B
capture_snap_len 0


% --- Other parameters ----------------------------------------------

% Run in the background instead of in a visible console window? If so, set the next parameter to 1, and 0 othervise.
% NOTE: Not implemented to Linux, so there this will be just ignored!
hide_console 0

% Whether or not to force the operation of the whole Probe to a single CPU core. 
% 	0 = The processor affinity is free
% 	1 = The Probe is forced to operate in CPU 0
force_to_single_cpu 0

% 0 = no, 1 = screen, 2 = file
write_inf_logs 2
