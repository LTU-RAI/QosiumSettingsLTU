# QosiumSettingsLTU

Author: [Emanuele Pagliari](https://github.com/Palia95)

The folder constains some screenshot example of the Qosium settings to both use the tool for measurement between a robot and the EDGE server, as well as the configuration file to enable Qosium to retrieve the 5G RF information from the Quectel 5G modems we have. 

NOTE: the RF information can be gathered only from the Quectel modems and the proper serial port must be specified in the config file.
